      <h1 class="presentation__content__title">About me</h1>
      <p class="presentation__content__description">I am an undergrad student in <strong class="presentation__content__description__strong">Internet Systems at the Catholic University of Pernambuco</strong> part of the <strong class="presentation__content__description__strong">Software Residency program at Porto Digital</strong> in Recife, Brazil. </p>
      <p class="presentation__content__description">I'm originally a Law School graduate and returning to college for a degree in Internet Systems as part of my career transition has been an amazing experience. For sure it was the boldest of my career decisions. I've had the privilege to collaborate with exceptional individuals and immerse myself in the enriching environment that my city offers.</p>
      <p class="presentation__content__description">I spent my childhood in between Rio and Recife, two amazing cities, but surely, being it my birthplace, <strong class="presentation__content__description__strong">Recife is part of my techie DNA</strong>. It is the tech capital of Brazil having the biggest population of IT undergrad students in the country and also home to Porto Digital, the biggest Brazilian urban tech park.</p>
